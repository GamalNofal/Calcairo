## ✨ Important Design & Development Guidelines

| Area | Rule |
|:---|:---|
| **Design Theme** | Use CalCairo green (#2e7d32) consistently across all components. |
| **Mobile Responsiveness** | All pages are mobile-first (flexible grids, text scaling). |
| **SEO Optimization** | Every page and post must include proper `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, and optional Schema. |
| **Performance** | Keep styles and scripts minimal, lightweight, and defer heavy loading where possible. |
| **Accessibility** | Use semantic HTML5 (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, etc.) and descriptive link texts. |
| **Consistent Layout** | Shared header and footer across all pages, matching the main homepage structure. |
| **Calculator Pages** | Centered layout, minimal width, consistent button/input styles. |
| **Blog Posts** | Simple, clean articles — no heavy boxes around content; soft typography with optional smooth fade-in animations. |
| **Internal Linking** | Link between calculators, blog posts, and main categories wherever relevant. |
| **Ads Ready** | Ensure enough visible space for future Google Ads integration without harming user experience. |
